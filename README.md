# NationalPark

## OUR VISION
1. Count visitors of the National Park 
2. Categorize: CHILDREN or ADULT
3. Measure temperature and humidity 
4. Count only if there is a person detected by pressure.

## Why we should count the visitors?
Nowadays, it is possible to count visitors in a cheap and privacy friendly way.
The obtained data could help us monitor, predict and also limit the number of visitors in a national park.
If there are too many visitors, they could harm the nature and the habitat of animals. 
Also, it we are able to measure the number of children and adults, therefore we can improve the sight according to the target audience.
Collecting other informations, like weather conditions, can help us better understand the visitorsâ€™ patterns.

## Components Used
To control the entries, the following tools will be used: 

Arduino Due
Ultrasonic Sensor
Force Sensor Resistor (FSR)
TFT LCD Screens 
HC-05 Bluetooth Module
DHT22 Temperature Sensor
